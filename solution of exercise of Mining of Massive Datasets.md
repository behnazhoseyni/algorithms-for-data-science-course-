## chapter 2( Large-Scale File Systems and Map-Reduce)
### section 2.3
**Exercise 2.3.1**: Design map-reduce algorithms to take a very large Ô¨Åle of integers and produce as output:<br>
(a) The largest integer.<br>
solution:let **s** is set of integer that is input<br>the map function:for each integer in **s** such t,produce key-value pair (1,t)<br>
the reduce function:input of this task is pair thet this key is 1,and associated value is list[t1,t2,...ti,...,tn] that each ti is value of pair of output of map task.output of reduce task is pair(1,max{t1,t2,....,tn})<br>
notice that max is a associative and commutative function,we can produce only one pair (1,max{t1,...tm}) in map task,that m is number of integer that input to map task.
